# moneyFlow

## Description: 
I didn't have MS Office, but didn't feel like paying for it, and I wanted to make something myself.<br/>
So I just made something to manage my money. This covers .xlsx files and .csv files<br/>

## How to use
- Just run the _moneyflow.py_ file or import it.
	- the _MoneyFlow_ class takes in the absolute path of the file and if using .xlsx file, needs the sheetname (None by default)

## Updates
    - January 23rd, 2020
	    - .xlsx file runs, but may run into errors, so .csv recommended
